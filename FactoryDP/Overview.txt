Remember : In Factory Design Pattern we use Factory class to create instance of the Concrete classes.

Basics : The Factory Design Pattern is a creational DP that provides a way to create an objects without exposing the 
		 creation logic to the client. It involves creating a factory class that is responsible for creating objects
		 of particular type based on the input provided by the client.

Steps : 1. We define the interface first which is will be implemented by the Concrete classes.
		Concrete class -> A class which implements the interface called as concrete class.

		2. We define Concrete classes that implement the interface defined in step 1.

		3. To create an instance of these concreate classes we use factory classes.

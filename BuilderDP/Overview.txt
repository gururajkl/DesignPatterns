The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object 
from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

The builder pattern separates the construction of the complex object from its representation 
by defining an abstract interface for building the object. 
This interface specifies the individual steps needed to construct the object, 
but it does not specify the actual implementation of those steps. 
This allows for different representations of the same complex object to be created using 
the same construction process.
